# Tips

## Use Components in MDX Without Import

You can predefine components that you usually use in the `mdx-components.tsx` file.

```tsx
// mdx-components.tsx
import {useMDXComponents as getThemeComponents} from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import {Callout} from "nextra/components";

// Get the default MDX components
const themeComponents = getThemeComponents()

// Merge components
export function useMDXComponents() {
    return {
        ...themeComponents,
        Callout: Callout
    }
}
```

Then in your MDX files, just use the component without import:
