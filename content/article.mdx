}
```

Building documentation sites can be challenging, but with Nextra, the process becomes surprisingly straightforward. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through everything you need to know to create your first Nextra site.

## Introduction

Documentation is the backbone of any successful project. Whether you're building an open-source library, an internal tool, or a product, good documentation can make or break the user experience. That's where Nextra comes in.

Nextra combines the power of Next.js with the simplicity of MDX to create a documentation framework that's both powerful and easy to use. It provides sensible defaults while remaining highly customizable.

## Why Choose Nextra?

Before diving into the technical details, let's understand what makes Nextra special:

### 1. Built on Next.js

Nextra leverages Next.js 15 and the App Router, giving you access to:
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Incremental static regeneration (ISR)
- Edge runtime support
- Optimized performance out of the box

### 2. MDX Support

Write your content in MDX, which means you can:
- Use standard Markdown syntax
- Import and use React components
- Create interactive examples
- Build custom layouts

### 3. Beautiful Themes

Nextra comes with two official themes:
- **Docs Theme** - Perfect for documentation sites
- **Blog Theme** - Ideal for content-focused blogs

Both themes are highly customizable and production-ready.

## Setting Up Your First Project

Let's create a new Nextra project from scratch. You'll need Node.js 18+ installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Create a New Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextra-site
cd my-nextra-site
```

### Step 2: Install Nextra

```bash
npm install nextra nextra-theme-docs
```

### Step 3: Configure Next.js

Update your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.tsx'
})

module.exports = withNextra()
```

### Step 4: Create Your Theme Config

Create `theme.config.tsx`:

```tsx
export default {
  logo: <span>My Documentation</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo'
  },
  docsRepositoryBase: 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/tree/main'
}
```

## Writing Content

Now comes the fun part - writing your documentation!

### Creating Pages

Create an MDX file in your `app` directory:

```markdown
---
title: My First Page
---

# Welcome to My Documentation

This is my first page using Nextra!
```

### Using Components

One of the best features of MDX is the ability to use React components:

```jsx
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
  This is an info callout with useful information!
</Callout>
```

### Code Blocks

Nextra provides beautiful syntax highlighting out of the box:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`
}
```

## Navigation Structure

The `_meta.tsx` file controls your navigation. Here's an example:

```typescript
export default {
  index: 'Introduction',
  'getting-started': 'Getting Started',
  guide: 'Guide',
  advanced: 'Advanced',
  about: {
    title: 'About',
    type: 'page'
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Components

Create reusable components for your documentation:

```tsx
// components/FeatureCard.tsx
export function FeatureCard({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <div className="feature-card">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Then use them in your MDX:

```mdx
import { FeatureCard } from '@/components/FeatureCard'

<FeatureCard
  title="Fast Performance"
  description="Built on Next.js for optimal speed"
/>
```

### Search Integration

Nextra supports multiple search providers:
- **Pagefind** - Static search (recommended)
- **Algolia** - Hosted search service
- **FlexSearch** - Client-side search

For Pagefind, simply install and configure:

```bash
npm install pagefind
```

### Internationalization

Support multiple languages easily:

```typescript
// theme.config.tsx
export default {
  i18n: [
    { locale: 'en', text: 'English' },
    { locale: 'es', text: 'Español' },
    { locale: 'fr', text: 'Français' }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment

Nextra sites can be deployed anywhere Next.js apps can:

### Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Netlify

```bash
npm run build
# Upload the .next directory
```

### Static Export

For fully static sites:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = withNextra({
  output: 'export',
  images: { unoptimized: true }
})
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple

Don't overcomplicate your structure. Start with the basics:
- Introduction

- API Reference
- Examples

### 2. Use Clear Navigation

Make it easy for users to find what they need:
- Logical grouping

- Structure

## Common Issues and Solutions
